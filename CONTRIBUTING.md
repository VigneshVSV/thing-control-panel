## I Have a Question

Do feel free to reach out to me at vignesh.vaidyanathan@hololinked.dev. This project is only upcoming, so inquries are dealt case to case. 
There can significant improvements made, so feel free to propose ideas. They can be solidified and integrated.

There are also repositories which can use your skills:
- [Python core server side](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked) in react
- [Documentation](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-docs) in sphinx which needs significant improvement in How-To's, beginner level docs which may teach people concepts of data acquisition or IoT, Docstring or API documentation of this repository itself 
- [Examples](https://github.com/VigneshVSV/hololinked-examples) in nodeJS, Dashboard/PyQt GUIs or server implementations using this package. Hardware implementations of unexisting examples are also welcome, I can open a directory where people can search for code based on hardware and just download your code.
